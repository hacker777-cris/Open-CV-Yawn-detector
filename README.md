Yawn Detection using OpenCV
This project utilizes OpenCV to detect yawning in real-time using a webcam feed.

Overview
Yawning detection is a crucial aspect of monitoring alertness levels, especially in scenarios like driver drowsiness detection systems. This project aims to detect yawning by analyzing facial landmarks and mouth opening in a live video stream.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
dlib (for facial landmark detection)
numpy
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/yawn-detection.git
cd yawn-detection
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install dlib
pip install numpy
Usage
Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python yawn_detection.py
Ensure your webcam is connected and focused on your face.

The program will open a live feed displaying the webcam output.

Yawning will be detected in real-time with visual indicators.
